		TypeScript - Operators
		What is an Operator?
		An operator defines some function that will be performed on the data. The data on which operators work are called operands. Consider the following expression:
		7 + 5 = 12
		Here, the values 7, 5, and 12 are operands, while + and = are operators.
		The major operators in TypeScript can be classified as:

		Arithmetic operators
		Logical operators
		Relational operators
		Bitwise operators
		Assignment operators
		Ternary/conditional operator
		String operator
		Type operator

		Relational Operators
		Relational Operators test or define the kind of relationship between two entities. Relational operators return a Boolean value, i.e., true/ false.
		Assume the value of A is 10 and B is 20.
